  abstract = {Accurate assessment of estimated fetal weight (EFW) is crucial in obstetrics, yet the exact contribution of biometric parameters in sonographic formulas remains unclear. Twenty-six datasets from published studies spanning diverse populations and gestational ages were analysed, incorporating measurements of biparietal diameter (BPD), abdominal circumference (AC), head circumference (HC) and femur length (FL). Sobol’ global sensitivity analysis—a variance‑based approach—quantified each parameter’s influence on EFW across 29 established formulas, and bootstrapping estimated the median of the sensitivity indices with 95% confidence intervals. Results showed that AC was generally the dominant predictor, especially in later pregnancy, while BPD, HC and FL exhibited variable importance depending on formula and gestational age. Two-thirds of the formulas demonstrated parameter crossover effects, and nearly half had at least one parameter with minimal contribution. These findings indicate that parameter significance differs by both formula and gestational age, suggesting that clinicians should select EFW formulas based on gestational age, measurement reliability and fetal characteristics. Estimates made with fewer than the intended parameters can be viable in emergencies. The proposed methodology can guide the refinement of existing formulas and the development of improved fetal weight estimation models.}

  abstract = {Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the development of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix, caused by a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Although in most of the cases it is resolved by the immune system, a small percentage of people might develop a more serious CIN which, if left untreated, can develop into cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally, for which the World Health Organization (WHO) recently adopted the Global Strategy for cervical cancer elimination by 2030. With this research topic being more imperative than ever, in this paper, we develop a nonlinear mathematical model describing the CIN progression. The model consists of partial differential equations describing the dynamics of epithelial, dysplastic, and immune cells, as well as the dynamics of viral particles. We use our model to explore numerically three important factors of dysplasia progression, namely, the geometry of the cervix, the strength of the immune response, and the frequency of viral exposure.}

It is a simplification of a complex one, recently introduced by two of the present authors. It serves for a compact study of the dynamical role in cancer promotion of a relatively recently described subgroup of regulatory B cells, which are evoked by the tumour.}

  abstract = {tBregs are a newly discovered subcategory of B regulatory cells, which are generated by breast cancer, resulting in the increase of Tregs and therefore in the death of NK cells. In this study, we use a mathematical and computational approach to investigate the complex interactions between the aforementioned cells as well as CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and B cells. Furthermore, we use data fitting to prove that the functional response regarding the lysis of breast cancer cells by NK cells has a ratio-dependent form. Additionally, we include in our model the concentration of rituximab - a monoclonal antibody that has been suggested as a potential breast cancer therapy - and test its effect, when the standard, as well as experimental dosages, are administered.}
