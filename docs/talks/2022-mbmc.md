## Abstract
We present our discoveries regarding the interactions of breast cancer and the immune system. In particular, we investigate the complex way tBregs, a newly discovered subgroup of B cells, interacts with the immune system. Additionally, we model the way NK cells lyse breast cancer cells. Finally, we test rituximab as a potential breast cancer cure.
