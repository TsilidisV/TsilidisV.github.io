## Abstract
tBregs are a newly discovered subcategory of B regulatory cells, which are generated by breast cancer, resulting in the increase of Tregs and therefore in the death of NK cells. In this study, we use a mathematical and computational approach to investigate the complex interactions between the aforementioned cells as well as CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and B cells. Furthermore, we use data fitting to prove that the functional response regarding the lysis of breast cancer cells by NK cells has a ratio-dependent form. Additionally, we include in our model the concentration of rituximab - a monoclonal antibody that has been suggested as a potential breast cancer therapy - and test its effect, when the standard, as well as experimental dosages, are administered.
