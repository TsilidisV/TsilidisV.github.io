abstract: 'In this paper, we introduce and study an age-structured epidemiological compartment model and its respective problem, applied but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to investigate the role of the age of the individuals in the evolution of epidemiological phenomena. We investigate the well-posedness of the model, as well as the global dynamics of it in the sense of basic reproduction number via constructing Lyapunov functions.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'We introduce an age-structured epidemiological compartment model and we analytically investigate its well-posedness and global stability.'
