abstract: tBregs are a newly discovered subcategory of B regulatory cells, which are generated by breast cancer, resulting in the increase of Tregs and therefore in the death of NK cells. In this study, we use a mathematical and computational approach to investigate the complex interactions between the aforementioned cells as well as CD8$^+$ T cells, CD4$^+$ T cells and B cells. Furthermore, we use data fitting to prove that the functional response regarding the lysis of breast cancer cells by NK cells has a ratio-dependent form. Additionally, we include in our model the concentration of rituximab - a monoclonal antibody that has been suggested as a potential breast cancer therapy - and test its effect, when the standard, as well as experimental dosages, are administered.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We analytically investigate the role of tBregs in breast cancer progression. We model the way NK cells lyse breast cancer cells. We test rituximab as a potential breast cancer cure.

  caption: 'NK cells lyse different tumor cell lines in different ways. The functional response of this lysis seems to follow a Michaelis-Menten function, with the variable being the ratio of NK cells to breast cancer cells, and the parameters depending on the tumor cell line.'
